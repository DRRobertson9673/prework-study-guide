# <Prework Study Guide project web application>

## Description

As a bootcamp student I created a web application so that my prework notes are structured on a webpage so that I can easily find and read information.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When I visit the website in my browser I see four boxes for each of the topics HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I can use the application to keep notes on each topic. If I open the DevTools console I can see JavaScript running. It will lists the topics I have learned from prework and will choose a topic for me to study first.
